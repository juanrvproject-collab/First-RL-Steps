# First-RL-Steps
My fisrts project of ReinforcementLearning in python.
Using RL, I was able to try an agent capable of crossing a complex maze no without taking first all the rewards before getting to the end.
The creation of the environment was possible thanks to an copilotation of Geminai, dispite that I could manage to train succesfully the agent.
This model is based on Q-Learning & the Bellman's Ecuacion.
